This is the newest Machine-Learning tool.

It does everything that all the other tools for Machine Learning do, but I wrote it, it is new, and so you should learn it, publicize it in every frea@#ing newspaper in the Tech world, and glorify it.

Oh yes, and if you are a newby, you now can wonder why you should use yet another machine leaning tool.

Isn't it great?

You are welcome BTW.

Thanks for trying. Now go back to your old tool...

and DO SOMETHING WITH IT, INSTEAD OF PLAYING WITH CODE AND INSTALLATIONS.

Oh yes, you want the code... THE CODE, yes we forgot.
